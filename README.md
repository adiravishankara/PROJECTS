# <div align="center"> MY PROJECTS</div>

The current projects are:
- A puzzle solver inspired by [StuffMadeHere](https://www.youtube.com/@StuffMadeHere). There are a lot of cool things he did but I think there are some changes that we can apply and make it better.
- A mechanical puzzle box that serves as an everyday clock. I have the parts ordered, I need to work on design and software. I will post this on [Hackaday](www.hackaday.io).
- I am very interested in developing an IoT Hydroponics system. I believe that with some work, growing food should be easily automatable.

Feel free to look through the branches. I will keep working on them as I have time. If the project grows to a point where it is something worth sharing, I'll generate a repository for it.
